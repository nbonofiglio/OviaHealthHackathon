In India, both private and public health professionals are obligated to provide treatment by law.  Denial of treatment of rape survivors is punishable under law. You do not need to file a police report before accessing medical services. Head to the nearest hospital or clinic immediately. 

Here is a checklist of what to expect and demand for the health care provider:

<ul>
<li> Health care provide should ask for you informed consent before examination, evidence collection and disclosing information to law enforcement agencies. Consent is mandatory before examination </li>
<li> Health provide will ask for detailed documentation of history of assault, gender sensitive examination, and may collectrelevant forensic evidence </li>
<li> This examination should be free and they should be able to refer you to appropriare mental health services </li>
<li> Health care provider should provide referalsto appropriate agencies for further help like legal support services, shelter services etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, there is no prepackaged standardized “kit” in India but there are established procedures for clinic examinations for sexual assaults survivors. </p>
<p>If your healthcare provider does not test for STIs, visit a testing center in Delhi. Follow up testing for STI’s should also occur 1-2 months after the assault.
